# 1stTry

Today I was enjoying my "resignation-celebration-waves" thinking of a tea and sun and no shit form ABOVE, but suddenly I felt something down at my butt. The pain of fidning another master to be his slave to be able to feed my fucking stomach to stay alive for the next working healthy day, with new HR PARTY, Wooooowooowooo! oh shit, I got mad agaian, no worries, back to the story;
when the pain came from my butt to my mind, again, my poetry spirit quickly went to the washroom downstairs and and I had the chance to fly my thought over some bullshit again.

Forgot to tell you the instruction:

in each of this repos, I'll include an OBSERVATION part in the begining, showing some proof of the importance of the topic. Reasons: 1)those who don't like to follow stop wasting their time on some bullshit. 2) everyone can realize that the world of data is full of terror and darkness, example: statista shares and instagram post having fantsy charts of top pepper usages in asian foods by county! This is aweful, this is crazy, this is a new war, against science. it's like letting a 4 year old kid watch porn, but the other way, think of it. pls.
